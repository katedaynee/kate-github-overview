## 👋 hey welcome! great to meet you here

i'm Kate, a highly self-motivated Asian NFTs researcher with global mind. i love what i do. here's the exp i collected. life is about experience.

- 🌱 currently i'm developing an NFT platform aimed at promoting mass adoption of NFTs in Asia (simply focus not bias). after working on different types of web3 and technology products, i realized the NFT segment empowers the community much more strongly than others in the blockchain space. living in its the culture, i become happier and value all friends contributing to NFTs. we've connected by one thing on top: Respect.
- **fun fact 1:** im grateful for the power of community. 2021 started fulltime for crypto, a community of 5 boosted my confidence thru hard time. AANC, each team member has different stories. we all commit to driving values for community.
- **fun fact 2:** even tho i've read more than 100 professional books so far, i don't love reading that much. it's because i'm too lazy to do too many A/B/C testings and wanted to find the most successful methods that work. share your concerns with me, and i'll recommend a book that can validate the hypothesis .___. LOL
