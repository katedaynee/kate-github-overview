## 👋 hey! great to meet you here

it's Kate! I'm a highly self-motivated an Asia NFTs researcher and marketer. I love working and I only do what I trust. working helps me understand myself.

- 🌱 currently, I'm developing an NFT platform aimed at promoting mass adoption of NFTs in Asia. after doing marketing for different types of projects in web3 and technology products since 2017, I realized the NFT segment empowers the community much more strongly than others in the blockchain space. Living in its the culture, I've becomed happier and value all friends contributing to NFTs. We're all connected by just one principle: Respect.
- **fun fact 1:** even though I've read more than 100 professional books so far, I don't actually enjoy reading. it's because I'm too lazy to do to many A/B/C testings and want to find the most successful methods that work :'< share your concerns with me, and I'll recommend a book that can validate the hypothesis ;)
- **fun fact 2:** Crypto never sleeps, but I sleep for 10 minutes every 1-2 hours haha. It's important to manage energy levels effectively. I think everyone has their own methods for achieving this balance. proper energy management contributes to productivity and overall satisfaction.
