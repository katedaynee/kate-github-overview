## 👋 hey! great to meet you here

it's Kate! I'm a highly motivated web3 marketing guru and I only choose to do what I love.

- 🌱 currently, I'm developing a product that caters to both NFT newbies and pro-collectors. after doing marketing for several types of projects in web3, I realized NFT sector empowers the community much more strongly than others in the space, with the culture of apes and shills. more than happy to experience it!
- **fun fact 1:** although I've read about 50 professional books so far, it's because I'm always lazy and looking for successful methods that work.
- **fun fact 2:** despite I work more than 10 hours per day, I don’t like working, work loves me 😢 =)) jk. crypto never sleeps. I manage to balance myself and take some time off.
- 💼 collab? reach out to me at [telegram](https://t.me/katedaynee). I always try to reply to you as soon as I can.
