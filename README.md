## 👋 Hey! Great to meet you here

It's Kate P. (Trinh)! I'm a highly motivated and enthusiastic web3 marketing guru.

- 🌱 Currently, I'm developing a product that caters to both NFT newbies and pro-collectors. After doing marketing for several types of projects in web2 & web3, I realized NFT sector empowers the community much more strongly than others in the space, with the culture of apes and shills. I just love it!
- **Fun fact 1:** Although I've read about 50 professional books so far, it's because I'm always lazy and looking for successful methods that work.
- **Fun fact 2:** Despite I work more than 10 hours per day, I don’t like working, work loves me 😢 =)) jk. Crypto never sleeps. I manage to balance myself and take some time off.
- 💼 work? do reach email
- 💬 ask me about anything, I am happy to help at telegram
