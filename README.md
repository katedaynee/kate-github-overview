## 👋 hey! great to meet you here

it's Kate! I'm a highly self-motivated Asia NFTs researcher and marketer. I love what I do.

- 🌱 currently, I'm developing an NFT platform aimed at promoting mass adoption of NFTs in Asia. after doing marketing for different types of projects in web3 and technology products, I realized the NFT segment empowers the community much more strongly than others in the blockchain space. living in its the culture, I've becomed happier and value all friends contributing to NFTs. we've connected by just one thing: respect.
- **fun fact 1:** even though I've read more than 100 professional books so far, I don't actually enjoy reading. it's because I'm too lazy to do too many A/B/C testings and wanted to find the most successful methods that work. share your concerns with me, and I'll recommend a book that can validate the hypothesis .___.
- **fun fact 2:** crypto never sleeps, but I sleep for 10 minutes every 1-2 hours haha. it's important to manage energy levels effectively. I think everyone has their own methods for achieving this balance. proper energy management contributes to productivity and overall satisfaction.
